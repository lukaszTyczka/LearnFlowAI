# Dashboard View Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the design for a revamped Dashboard view, taking into account the product requirements (@prd.md) and the tech stack (@tech-stack.md).

## Layout Design

1. **Left Sidebar**

   - Displays a menu with a list of categories.
   - At the top left, show user information including the logged-in user's email and a logout button.

2. **Main Display Area**

   - Upon clicking a category, the main area shows saved notes for the selected category.
   - At the top of this area, display a textarea for note entry along with a 'Save' button.
   - Implement validation (using a library or custom solution) to ensure that notes meet the required conditions before saving.

3. **Note Details View**
   - When a note is clicked, display its detailed view showing:
     - The original content of the note.
     - The generated summary.
     - The Q&A set associated with the note.

## Additional Considerations

- Ensure the layout is responsive and matches the project's styling guidelines (Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui components).
- Follow best practices for error handling and accessibility (including ARIA labels and proper focus management).
- Maintain consistency with the overall app design and user experience standards.
